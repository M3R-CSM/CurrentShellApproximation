# CurrentShellApproximation
Calculates the Current-Shell approximation for a real solenoid.

The attached code calculates a current-shell approximation for a real solenoid and plots the percent error for the approximation as compared to a exact solution.  The current-shell approximation is exact for axially magnetized cylindrical magnets and the provided BFieldShell can be used for that case as well.  The approach implemented is outlined in the paper:
